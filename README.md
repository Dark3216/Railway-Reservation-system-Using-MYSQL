Introduction to Railway Reservation System 🚆🎟️
The Railway Reservation System is a database-driven project designed to facilitate train ticket booking, passenger management, and payment processing. This system helps railway authorities and passengers by automating the reservation process, reducing manual effort, and improving efficiency.

In traditional railway booking systems, passengers had to visit ticket counters physically, leading to long queues and delays. With digital transformation, this automated system provides an efficient way to handle train schedules, seat availability, bookings, and cancellations online.

Key Features of the System
✔ User Authentication & Roles – Allows different users (Admin, Passenger) to access the system securely.
✔ Train & Schedule Management – Stores details of trains, including number, name, type, and arrival time.
✔ Online Ticket Booking – Enables passengers to search for trains and reserve seats.
✔ Passenger & Booking Management – Maintains records of passengers and their travel details.
✔ Payment Processing – Supports multiple payment methods (UPI, Credit/Debit Card, Net Banking, etc.).
✔ Data Security & Integrity – Implements foreign key constraints to maintain database consistency.

The project is developed using SQL for database management, ensuring data is structured efficiently for fast retrieval and processing. It can be integrated into a web or mobile application to provide a seamless user experience.

This Railway Reservation System aims to enhance the passenger experience by making ticket booking hassle-free and efficient while providing railway authorities with a streamlined management process.
